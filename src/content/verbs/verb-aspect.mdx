Pashto verbs express actions by looking at them from two different [aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect).

#### 1. <i className="fas fa-video" /> Imperfective Aspect

The imperfective aspect is used for looking at the action as a process that's continuous or repeating over time, kind of like a video.

<div className="text-center">
    <img className="img-fluid mb-2" src={imperfectiveTimeline} alt="imperfective aspect in time" />
</div>

For example:

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "ما ډوډۍ خوړله", f: "maa DoDuy khoRúla", e: "I was eating food" },
]}</Examples>

#### 2. <i className="fas fa-camera" /> Perfective Aspect

The perfective aspect is used for looking at the action as a complete whole, without thinking about repititon or the flow of time, kind of like a photo.

<div className="text-center">
    <img className="img-fluid mb-2" src={perfectiveTimeline} alt="perfective aspect in time" />
</div>

For example:

<Examples opts={opts}>{[
    { p: "ما ډوډۍ وخوړله", f: "maa DoDuy óokhoRula", e: "I ate food" },
]}</Examples>

As we saw in the examples above, in English we are used to using these two different aspects with the past tense. But **Pashto uses these two aspects for almost *everything!*** This is very import to remember and it takes a while for learners to get used to.

For example, when making commands in Pashto we have to choose which aspect we are talking about. In English we can only say "clean your room!" But in Pashto we have to think, are we talking about a one-time request to get something done (perfective <i className="fas fa-camera" />), or asking someone to work on something as on ongoing, repeated thing (imperfective <i className="fas fa-video" />)?

<table class="table" style={{ tableLayout: "fixed" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"><i className="fas fa-video fa-lg" /> Imperfective</th>
      <th scope="col"><i className="fas fa-camera fa-lg" /> Perfective</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <Examples opts={opts}>{[
                { p: "خبله کوټه صفا کوه!", f: "khpula koTa safaa kawa!", e: "Clean your room!" },
            ]}</Examples>
        </td>
        <td>
            <Examples opts={opts}>{[
                { p: "خبله کوټه صفا کړه!", f: "khpula koTa safaa kRa!", e: "Clean your room!" },
            ]}</Examples>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"Do it generally, or get going on it." (Asking someone to clean their room as an ongoing or repeated task.)</td>
      <td>"Just get it done, once." (Asking someone to clean their room as a one-time task. Just get it done, once.)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Or when talking about things in the future tense, we face the same choice of aspect:

<table class="table" style={{ tableLayout: "fixed" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"><i className="fas fa-video fa-lg" /> Imperfective</th>
      <th scope="col"><i className="fas fa-camera fa-lg" /> Perfective</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <Examples opts={opts}>{[
                { p: "مونږ به کېنو او خبرې کوو", f: "moonG ba keenóo aw khabure kawoo", e: "We'll sit and talk" },
            ]}</Examples>
        </td>
        <td>
            <Examples opts={opts}>{[
                { p: "مونږ به کېنو او خبرې وکړو", f: "moonG ba kéenoo aw khabure ookRoo", e: "We'll sit and talk" },
            ]}</Examples>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>We'll have a process of sitting and talking together (this will happen repeatedly or will take time)</td>
      <td>We'll sit down and have a talk (a one time event, thought of as a whole)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In the next chapters (coming soon) we'll learn how to actually make verbs with these two different aspects. For now, it's just important to **be aware that they exist**. It takes a long time for learners to get used to the idea that they have to use the right aspect for almost everything. Otherwise, we tend to pick an aspect without thinking and sound completely wrong or confusing 50% of the time. 🤦‍♂️
