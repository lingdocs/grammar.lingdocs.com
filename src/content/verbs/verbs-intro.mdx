In any language we have different **verb forms** that are used for different reasons. For example, in English here are some different verb forms:

- I am going
- I go
- I'll go
- I'll be going
- I went
- I was going
- I've gone
- I'll have gone

These **different verb forms are like tools 🔨🔧✂ that you can use in different situations**. 

⚠ **Different languages have different sets of tools that are used in different ways**. When learning a new language it's important to remember that you are getting a _new toolbox full of new tools_ 🆕🧰🗜⚒✨ When you get a new set of tools you need to make sure you understand:

1. What they are (how to make the verb forms)
2. When to use them (what they mean and what situations they're used in)

If we don't think carefully about this, 🤔 we will often just assume that we can use the new tools (verb forms) just like we did in our native language. As adults, there is a massive temptation to shove the new verb forms into the categories that we have in our own language, and to try to use the tools like we did before. We can think we know the tool, but because it's actually different we end up using it wrongly and sometimes even cause damage!

For example, you may have met a German who's learned excellent English, but when the doorbell rings they jump up and say, _"I get the door!"_ 🔔🚪🏃‍♂️. In English you have to use a different verb form and say, "I'll get the door." But they're so used to using their trusty German tool (the Präsens) for everything that saying "I get the door" still "feels right" to them, even though it's completely wrong. Taking careful stock of a new set of tools (verb forms) in a language can keep us from mistakes like this. 🧰🤓👍

In the chapters ahead we will try to explain what the different forms of the verbs are and when to use them. But first, it's important to understand a little bit about <Link to="/verbs/verb-aspect/">verb aspect</Link>.
