In the <Link to="/inflection/inflection-intro/">previous chapter</Link> we talked about **why** words inflect. Now we will explain **how** words inflect. What actualy happens to them? How do they change?

Like many things in Pashto, inflection can seem mysterious and intimidating. Why do the words change so much, and how!? ðŸ˜© But, we'll see that there are just a few basic patterns that the words follow, and it's not so scary or confusing after all.

Below are the **5 basic patterns for inflecting** nouns and adjectives. Notice how all these patterns work with both masculine and feminine genders.

Don't worry about memorizing them all perfectly to start. Instead keep looking back and use them as guides to help you as you get familiar with the inflections over time.

## Words ending in a consonant

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "consonant", "ØºÙ¼")} />

## Words ending in an unstressed <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÛŒ", f: "ey" }} />

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "ey-unstressed", "Ø³ØªÚ“ÛŒ")} />  

## Words ending in a stressed <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ÛŒ", f: "Ã©y" }} />

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "ey-stressed", "Ù„ÙˆÙ…Ú“ÛŒ")} />  

## Words with the "Pashtun" pattern

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "aanu", "Ù¾ÚšØªÙˆÙ†")} />

Note: Nouns in this pattern will often only use the first inflection for the plural. Adjectives will use the 1st inflection for all 3 reasons.

## Shorter irregular words

<InflectionCarousel items={startingWord(words, "short-irreg", "ØºÙ„")} />
