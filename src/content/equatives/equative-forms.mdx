## Present Equative

This is used to say something is something currently.

<FormChoice 
    forms={{
        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm(
                [grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.present,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["He/it is ...", "They are ..."],
                ["She/it is ...", "They are ..."],
            ],
        },
        pure: {
            displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.present,
        }
    }}
/>

## Subjunctive / Habitual Equative

This is used to talk about something being something, when the statement involves a wish, desire, hope, or statement of whether it should or shouldn't be.

It is also used to say that something is generally or repeatedly something. This is like the the [habitual be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_be) found in African American Vernacular English (AAVE), as in, "The grass *be* wet in the morning."

It's the same as the present equative above, except for the 3rd person.

<FormChoice 
    forms={{
        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm(
                [grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["I am ...", "We are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["You are ...", "You are ..."],
                ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
                ["He/she/it is ...", "They are ..."],
            ],
        },
        pure: {
            displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
        },
    }}
/>

## Future / Presumptive Equative

This is used to say that something will be something in the future. It's also used to guess or surmise about something being something.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={grammarUnits.baParticle} /> + <Link to="#subjunctive--informative-equative">subjunctive/informative equative</Link>
</Formula>

<FormChoice
    forms={{
        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm([
                    grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain,
                    " ",
                    grammarUnits.baParticle,
                    " ",
                    { p: "...", f: "..." },
                    " ",
                ],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I will be ...", "We will be ..."],
                ["I will be ...", "We will be ..."],
                ["You will be ...", "You will be ..."],
                ["You will be ...", "You will be ..."],
                ["He/she/it will be ...", "They will be ..."],
                ["He/she/it will be ...", "They will be ..."],
            ],
        },
        pure: {
            displayForm: addToForm([
                grammarUnits.baParticle,
                " ",
                { p: "...", f: "..." },
                " ",
            ], grammarUnits.equativeEndings.subjunctive)
        },
    }}
/>

## Past Equative

This is used to say that something was something in the past.

It is usually used in the short form.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ول", f: "wul" }} /> + <Link to="/verbs/verb-endings/#past-verb-endings">past verb endings</Link>
</Formula>

<FormChoice
    forms={{
        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm([
                grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain, " ", { p: "...", f: "..." }, " "],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I was ...", "We were ..."],
                ["I was ...", "We were ..."],
                ["You were ...", "You were ..."],
                ["You were ...", "You were ..."],
                ["He/it was ...", "They were ..."],
                ["She/it was ...", "They were ..."],
            ],
        },
        pure: {
            displayForm: grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past,
        },
    }}
/>

## Affirmative Equative

This is used to affirm or to make a strong assumption that something will be something.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={grammarUnits.baParticle} /> + <Link to="#past-equative">past equative</Link>
</Formula>

<FormChoice
    forms={{
        sentence: {
            displayForm: addToForm([
                    grammarUnits.pronouns.far.plain,
                    " ",
                    grammarUnits.baParticle,
                    " ",
                    { p: "...", f: "..." },
                    " ",
                ],
                grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past,
            ),
            english: [
                ["I'll be ...", "We'll be ..."],
                ["I'll be ...", "We'll be ..."],
                ["You'll be ...", "You'll be ..."],
                ["You'll be ...", "You'll be ..."],
                ["He/she/it'll be ...", "They'll be ..."],
                ["He/she/it'll be ...", "They'll be ..."],
            ],
        },
        pure: {
            displayForm: addToForm([
                grammarUnits.baParticle,
                " ",
                { p: "...", f: "..." },
                " ",
            ], grammarUnits.equativeEndings.past)
        }
    }}
/>

## Conterfactual / Past Subjunctive / Wish Equative

This is used to talk about something being hypothetically something, or to wish that something were something. It is also used for prayers and blessings in some dialects.

Because this uses the non-inflecting tail, it doesn't change at all depending on the person.

<Formula>
    <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "و", f: "w" }} /> + non-inflecting tail
</Formula>

export function WithTailChoice() {
    const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState("aay");
    const waay = concatPsString(
        {p: "و", f: "w"},
        choice === "aay" ? { p: "ای", f: "aay" } : { p: "ی", f: "ey" },
    );
    return (
        <div>
            <div className="text-center my-3">
                <div className="text-muted mb-1">
                    <small>The spelling/pronunciation of the non-inflecting tail can vary based on dialect</small>
                </div>
                <ButtonSelect
                    options={[
                        { label: <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ای", f: "aay" }} />, value: "aay" },
                        { label: <InlinePs opts={opts} ps={{ p: "ی", f: "ey" }} />, value: "ey" },
                    ]}
                    value={choice}
                    handleChange={(p) => setChoice(p)}
                />
            </div>
            <FormChoice
                forms={{
                    sentence: {
                        displayForm: concatPsString(
                            { p: "کاشکې ... ...", f: "kaashke ... ..."}, " ",
                            waay, { p: "!", f: "!" },
                        ),
                        english: [[["If only ... was/were ...!"]]],
                    },
                    pure: {
                        displayForm: waay,
                    }
                }}
            />
        </div>
    );
}

<WithTailChoice />
